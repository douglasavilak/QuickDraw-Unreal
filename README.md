 ## How to play
 It's a mini game where the idea is to be faster than the enemy on drawing your sword.

 When played there will be a certain time delay where both the player and the enemy stare themselves.

 At some point it an exclamation point will appear in the middle of the screen. That's when you do your move!

 If you're quick enough you beat the enemy

 If not, the player defeats you.

 If you try to draw your sword before the exclamation point appears, you get locked and the enemy beats you.
